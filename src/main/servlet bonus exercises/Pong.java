//   4. Create a servlet that listens for requests to ```/ping``` and a servlet that listens
//   for requests to ```/pong```. The former servlet should simply return a link that sends
//   a request to the latter, and vice versa! If successfully built, the user should
//   be able to cycle back and forth between two pages by clicking on a
//   ```PING!``` or ```PONG!``` link.
